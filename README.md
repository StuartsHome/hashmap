<p align="center">A hash map written in C</p>

## Intro

I wanted to learn C and the idea of creating an LRU Cache seemed like a reasonable project to learn the basics.  
As it turned out, I needed a Hash Map to implement the Cache, and C doesn't have a built-in Hash Map.  
The result is this project that is a simple hash map written in C that I can include in the LRU Cache.
